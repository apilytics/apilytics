# Bring Your Own Middleware (BYOM) üë®‚Äçüíª

If your backend supports none of our open source middlewares,
you can still use Apilytics by implementing your own middleware.

Simply perform an HTTP request to `https://apilytics.io/api/v1/middleware`
for all of the requests that you want to track with Apilytics.

The HTTP requests must have the following specs:

`Method: POST`

```
Headers:
- "Content-Type": "application/json"
- "X-API-Key": "<your_api_key>"
```

<br />

```
Body:
- "path": The path of the endpoint, e.g. "/api/v1/users".
- "method": The HTTP method of the request that you want to track.
- "timeMillis": The time in milliseconds that the request took to complete.

```

Note that your request should take place as a background job
in your API and thus not bottlenecking your API in any way.
