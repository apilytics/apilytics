### Bring Your Own Middleware (BYOM) üë®‚Äçüíª

<br />

If your backend supports none of our open source middlewares
and you cannot use our core modules to build your own middleware,
you can still use Apilytics by implementing your own middleware.

<br />

Currently we have the following core modules that you can use to implement your own middleware:

- Node.js: <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apilytics/core">@apilytics/core</ExternalLink>
- Python: <ExternalLink href="https://pypi.org/project/apilytics">apilytics</ExternalLink>

<br />

The middleware must simply send HTTP requests to `https://www.apilytics.io/api/v1/middleware`
for all the requests that you want to track with Apilytics.

<br />

Check the specs for the request from our interactive <ExternalLink href={routes.apiDocs}>OpenAPI/Swagger docs</ExternalLink>.

<br />

Note that your request should be done as a background job
in your API and this way not bottleneck your API in any way.
