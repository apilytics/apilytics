### Get started in 5 minutes ⚡

<br />

#### [1. Sign up 🚀](#sign-up) {#sign-up}

Star your free trial at <ExternalLink href={routes.register} children={FRONTEND_URL + routes.register} />.
You can start your free trial without assigning a credit card. We use magic links for authentication
so you don’t have to remember your password.

<Link href={routes.register}>
  <Button className="btn-primary btn-outline mt-4">Sign up here!</Button>
</Link>

<br />

#### [2. Grab your API key 🔑](#api-key) {#api-key}

After you've signed up and finished up your account,
you can register your APIs using what we call "origins".

These are plain APIs that correspond to one source that sends their data to our middleware.
Each origin will have a dedicated API key that will link your origins to your account.

You can create a new origin from the origins view by clicking the "Add Origin" button.
You need to give a unique name to your origin which will be used to identify it.

After you've created your origin, you will be taken to the dasboard and you can see your API key.
This is all you need to do in the UI side for getting started. You can also access your API key
later in the origin settings.

<br />

#### [3. Install the open source middleware 👨‍💻](#install-middleware) {#install-middleware}

Our open-source middlewares are easy to integrate with your backend.
We currently have plug & play solutions for the following frameworks:

- <Link href={routes.node + '#express'}>Express.js</Link>
- <Link href={routes.node + '#next'}>Next.js</Link>
- <Link href={routes.python + '#django'}>Django</Link>
- <Link href={routes.python + '#fastapi'}>FastAPI</Link>

See instructions for integrating other frameworks <Link href={routes.byom}>here</Link>.
The service is still in beta and we're working hard to add more integrations ASAP.
