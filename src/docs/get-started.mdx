#### Sign up & grab your API key 🔑

Create your free account at <ExternalLink href="/login">https://apilytics.io/login</ExternalLink>.
You can start your free trial without assigning a credit card.
After you've signed up and finished up your account,
you can register your APIs using what we call "origins".
These are plain APIs that correspond to one source that sends their data to our middleware.
Each origin will have a dedicated API key that will link your origins to your account.

#### Embed our open-source middleware to your backend 👨‍💻

Our open-source middlewares offer a plug & play solution for integrating with your backend.
We currently have support for the following backends:

- [Node.js/Express](/docs/javascript)
- [Next.js](/docs/javascript)
- [Django](/docs/python)
- [FastAPI](/docs/python)

Note that we're still in beta and we're working on integrating with other frameworks constantly.
However, this doesn't stop you from integrating with your backend even if there's no official middlware for it yet.
You can still use Apilytics by <Link href="/docs/byom">implementing your own middleware (BYOM)</Link>.
