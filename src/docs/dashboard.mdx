### Dashboard Guide üìä

<br />

Now that your API has been integrated with our middleware,
the requests from your API will start appearing in your dashboard.

You can track business-critical metrics like amount of requests to your different endpoints,
response times, HTTP methods, status codes etc.

The dashboard is quite self-explanatory, but the visualization is divided into three categories:

<br />

#### [Time Frame ‚åõ](#time-frame) {#time-frame}

<br />

![Time Frame](/mock-ups/time-frame.png)

<br />

The time frame allows you to visualize the API requests to your origin over a specified time frame.
In addition to the total amount of requests and the historical view, you can also see the growth from the previous time frame that you've selected.
So if you've for instance selected 24 hours as the time frame, the growth will be calculated from the previous 24 hours that is not shown on the graph.

<br />

#### [Endpoint Requests üßê](#endpoint-metrics) {#endpoint-metrics}

<br />

![Endpoint Requests](/mock-ups/endpoint-requests.png)

<br />

The endpoint requests bar chart breaks down your requests to their corresponding endpoints.
From the right-hand side you can see the amount of requests to each endpoint.
By clicking on individual endpoints you can get a set of additional information for the given endpoint.

<br />

#### [Endpoint Response Times ‚ö°](#endpoint-response-times) {#endpoint-response-times}

<br />

![Endpoint Response Times](/mock-ups/endpoint-response-times.png)

<br />

The endpoint-specific response time visualization gives you a similar overview than the endpoint requests visualization,
except that the endpoints have been sorted by the average response times that it took for the endpoints to respond.

The percentile thresholds tell you the exact thresholds under which a certain percentage of the requests to the endpoint have responded.
So for instance the `p75` threshold means that 75% of the requests made to the endpoint have a response time under the specified value for the given `p75` value.

<br />

#### [How to spot bottlenecks? üçº](#bottlenecks) {#bottlenecks}

<br />

With the combination of response times, percentile thresholds and the amount of requests to each endpoint,
you can spot bottlenecks in your API. E.g. having large percentile thresholds means that your endpoint is probably slow.

The endpoint metrics charts give you a nice breakdown of your different endpoints and allow you to do comparisons between your endpoints.
The time frame gives you an overview about the trends of your API and prepares you for e.g. peak hours.
