### Dashboard guide ðŸ“Š

<br />

Now that your API has been integrated with our middleware,
the requests from your API will start appearing in your dashboard.

You can track business-critical metrics like amount of requests to your different endpoints,
response times, HTTP methods, status codes etc.

The dashboard is quite self-explanatory, but the visualization is divided into three categories:

<br />

#### Time frame metrics {#requests-time-frame}

<br />

![Requests time frame](/mock-ups/requests-time-frame.png)

<br />

The requests time frame allows you to visualize the API requests to your origin over a specified time frame.
In addition to the total amount of requests and the historical view, you can also see the growth from the previous time frame that you've selected.
So if you've for instance selected 24 hours as the time frame, the growth will be calculated from the previous 24 hours that is not shown on the graph.

<br />

![Errors time frame](/mock-ups/errors-time-frame.png)

<br />

The errors time frame allows you to visualize the errors that have occurred in your API over a specified time frame.
You can monitor the total amount of the errors over the time frame as well as the growth from the previous time frame.
So if you've for instance selected 24 hours as the time frame, the growth will be calculated from the previous 24 hours that is not shown on the graph.

<br />

#### Endpoint metrics {#endpoint-metrics}

<br />

![Endpoint requests](/mock-ups/endpoint-requests.png)

<br />

The endpoint requests bar chart breaks down your requests to their corresponding endpoints.
From the right-hand side you can see the amount of requests to each endpoint.
You can use the endpoints as filters by clicking them.

<br />

![Endpoint response times](/mock-ups/endpoint-response-times.png)

<br />

The endpoint-specific response time visualization gives you a similar overview than the endpoint requests visualization,
except that the endpoints have been sorted by the average response times that it took for the endpoints to respond.

You may combine your dynamic endpoints into one by navigating to the "Dynamic routes" settings from the top-right menu.
Yuu may also exclude specific routes or routes having a certain patter from the "Excluded routes" section from the same menu.

<br />

#### Performance metrics {#performance-metrics}

The percentile thresholds tell you the exact thresholds that the specified values are within.
So for instance the `p75` threshold for the response times means that 75% of the requests made to the endpoint have a response time under the specified value for the given `p75` value.

<br />

![Performance response times](/mock-ups/performance-response-times.png)

<br />

The response time tab shows you average and percentile values for response times of your endpoints.

<br />

![Performance request sizes](/mock-ups/performance-request-sizes.png)

<br />

The request size tab shows you average and percentile values for request sizes of your endpoints.
The request size indicates the size of the body of the requests logged by your APIs.

<br />

![Performance response sizes](/mock-ups/performance-response-sizes.png)

<br />

The response size tab shows you average and percentile values for response sizes of all of your endpoints.
The response size indicates the size of the body of the request responses logged by your APIs.

<br />

![Performance CPU usage](/mock-ups/performance-cpu-usage.png)

<br />

The CPU usage tab shows you average and percentile values for CPU usage of your endpoints.
The CPU usage is calculated for each request logged by your API separately and the data you see in the dashboard is aggrated from the logged requests.

<br />

![Performance memory usage](/mock-ups/performance-memory-usage.png)

<br />

The memory usage tab shows you average and percentile values for memory usage of your endpoints.
The memory usage is absolute and calculated for each request logged by your API separately and the data you see in the dashboard is aggrated from the logged requests.

<br />

![Performance total memory](/mock-ups/performance-total-memory.png)

<br />

The total memory tab shows you average and percentile values for the total memory of your endpoints.
The values indicate the total available memory in your API and the data you see in the dashboard is aggrated from individual requests.

<br />

#### Status code metrics {#status-code-metrics}

<br />

![Status code metrics](/mock-ups/status-code-metrics.png)

<br />

The status code metrics show you how many times your API has responded with the shown status codes.
You can use the status codes as filters by clicking them.

<br />

#### User agent metrics {#user-agent-metrics}

<br />

![Browser metrics](/mock-ups/user-agent-browsers.png)

<br />

The browser metrics show you which browser have been used to make requests to your APIs.
You can use the browsers as filters by clicking them.

<br />

![Operating system metrics](/mock-ups/user-agent-operating-systems.png)

<br />

The operating system metrics show you which operating systems have been used to make requests to your APIs.
You can use the browsers a filters by clicking them.

<br />

![Device metrics](/mock-ups/user-agent-devices.png)

<br />

The device metrics show you which type of devices have been used to make requests to your APIs.
You can use the devices as filters by clicking them.

<br />

#### How to spot bottlenecks? {#bottlenecks}

<br />

With the combination of response times, percentile thresholds and the amount of requests to each endpoint,
you can spot bottlenecks in your API. E.g. having large percentile thresholds means that your endpoint is probably slow.

The endpoint metrics charts give you a nice breakdown of your different endpoints and allow you to do comparisons between your endpoints.
The time frame gives you an overview about the trends of your API and prepares you for e.g. peak hours.
