This is a registry and privacy policy in accordance with the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). Last updated on 2022-01-13.

### 1. General

We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard, and we
do not collect or process any information about you that is not necessary for
the operation of the service. This privacy policy contains information about
what personal information we collect, how we process it, and what rights and
opportunities you have over your information.

The Apilytics service processes personal information about you in
accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law, so we ask that you read
this privacy policy carefully. When you use our services, our website or
contact us, your personal data is processed in accordance with this privacy
policy.

### 2. For what purpose is my personal data collected and processed?

We collect, store and process personal information about you only for
pre-defined purposes. Uses include:

- Fulfillment of legal obligations and requirements
- Ensuring the security of the service
- Customer communication and answering contact requests
- Improving the usability of the service, e.g. showing personalized content
- Prevention of abuse and harassment

### 3. What personal information about me is collected and from what sources?

We collect personal information about you directly from you or your device when
you use our service or contact us.

When you sign up we collect your email address. When you use the service, we
collect the data for your origins and all metrics that the origins send to
Apilytics through one of our open-source integration packages that you have
installed. The origin data includes the name that you have provided for your
origin. The metrics data includes HTTP methods, paths, status codes, paths, and
request times. The integration must be installed manually by you, and you are
responsible that you possess the necessary rights for the data that is sent
through the integration code to the Apilytics service. We also collect your
email address when you join your mailing list. You can unsubscribe and delete
that email info from us, by opening the unsubscribe link from any email that
you have received.

The above information must be provided in order for us to provide the service
to you. You are not legally obligated to provide the information, but in that
case you will not be able to use our services.

In addition, some basic request information (e.g. IP-addresses, access times,
and user agents) might be collected by us or our hosting provider.

We also use third party analytics tools to collect visitor data from the
Apilytics website so that we can improve it. The data collected by them
contains aggregate information from for example the number of visitors and the
number of page views, and none of it can be connected to any individual users.

### 4. On what basis is personal data processed?

We make sure that we always have a legal basis for processing your personal
information. We process your personal information to provide our service to
you, improve our service and to manage the customer relationship between us and
you as the user of our service. The legal basis for such processing is the
performance of our mutual agreement (art. 6 1. b of the GDPR).

### 5. Who processes my data and is it passed on to third parties?

Your personal data is processed by persons belonging to our staff
in the performance of their duties. In this case, we take care, among other
things, by agreements that the confidentiality of your information is
maintained, and that the information is processed in a lawful manner.

We may disclose your information to our contractual partners and/or
subcontractors when it is necessary in order to provide our service. These
partners include our hosting providers ([Vercel](https://vercel.com),
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)) and email service
([Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)). In these situations, we will take the
necessary steps to protect your information, e.g. by signing appropriate data
processing agreements with the processors.

We may also disclose your information to third parties or relevant authorities
when required by law or by a competent authority, and to relevant third parties
in connection of a planned share or business acquisition or sale.

### 6. Will my data be disclosed outside the EU?

Your data won't generally be transferred or processed outside the EU/EEA. However, there are
situations where our partner or subcontractor used for providing the service, either resides or
needs to transfer information outside the EU/EEA. These partners or subcontractors may process
personal data when providing, for example, IT- or hosting services. In these cases, sufficient data
protection is ensured by using approved transfer mechanisms, such as signing EU Commission’s
standard contractual clauses in connection with the transfer.

### 7. How long will my personal information be kept?

We will automatically delete your data after two years of inactivity.

### 8. How is my information stored and protected?

Your information is stored on servers of the service providers described in
section 5. The servers are protected in accordance with general industry
practices and modern standards. The data and disclosing or transfer of the data
is handled in accordance with sections 5 and 6 of this privacy policy.
