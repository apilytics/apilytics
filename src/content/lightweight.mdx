  your APIs whatsoever.
</h5>

<br />

#### Small build size

Our client libraries do no heavy processing on the server thus they are light. For instance, our
core JavaScript module is just <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apilytics/core">18kB unpacked</ExternalLink>.

<br />

#### How will it affect performance?

Using Apilytics middlewares won't slow down your APIs in any way because all requests as done in
the background.

<br />

#### Does it have 3rd party dependencies?

None. This applies to all middlewares across all the supported languages.

<br />

#### What if there's no middleware for my backend?

Our API 100% supports using your own middlewares. We also have tools that you can use to build
your own middleware to use our APIs. See more info in our <Link href={routes.byom}>docs</Link>.
