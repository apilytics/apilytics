### Lightweight âš¡

<br />

<p className="text-xl">
  Apilytics middlewares are super lightweight, fast and they will cause no performance impact on
  your APIs whatsoever.
</p>

<br />

![Mock Up](/mock-ups/time-frame.gif)

<br />

#### [Small Build Size](#small-build-size) {#small-build-size}

Our client libraries do no heavy processing on the server and thus they are light.
For instance, our core JavaScript module is just <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apilytics/core">9kB unpacked</ExternalLink>.

<br />

#### [How Will the Middleware Affect My API Performance?](#performance) {#performance}

Using Apilytics middlewares won't slow down your APIs in any way because all requests as done in the background.

<br />

#### [What 3rd Party Dependencies Does the Middleware Have?](#dependencies) {#dependencies}

None. This applies to all middlewares accross all of the supported languages.

<br />

#### [What Other Options Do I Have Apart From the Official Middlewares?](#other-options) {#other-options}

If you feel like not using our middlewares for any reason, our API also 100% supports using your own middlewares.
We also have tools that you can use to build your own middleware to use our APIs. See more info in our <Link href={routes.byom}>docs</Link>.
