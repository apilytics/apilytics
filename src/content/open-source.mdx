### Open Source üåê

<p className="text-xl">
  We want to be transparent on how we process the data of our users. This is why we have open
  sourced 100% of our client middleware code, keeping our users updated on what data from their API
  is processed.
</p>

#### BYOM (Bring Your Own Middleware)

If any of our official middleware libraries are not suitable for your use,
you are free to use your own middleware library either by using our tools or implementing one from scratch.
Learn more about using a custom middleware in our [docs](/docs/byom).

<br />

#### How to Contribute?

We highly appreciate any work that helps our users to better interact with our API.
Feel free to contact us if you feel like your implementation could be made official.
Also check out our <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/apilytics">Github</ExternalLink> for our open source work.
