Using Apilytics, you can track your mobile app users separately from your web application users.
Our dashaboard let's you see which type of clients are consuming your APIs.

#### [Combine metrics with other data](#combine-metrics) {#combine-metrics}

By tracking your API instead of embedding various web analytics tools in your client applications
that the majority of your users are blocking, you will have combined data accross all of the sources.
This allows you to easily compare e.g. metrics from your website users with your mobile app users.
