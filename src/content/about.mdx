#### What Makes Apilytics Different From Other API Monitoring Services?

Apilytics differs from other providers with its ease of use, privacy friendliness, flexible
pricing and full transparency. Using our product requires no prior monitoring experience and
anyone with an existing application can get started in a few minutes. We do not make our users
install any kind of software on their servers apart from our lightweight middlewares that are
directly plugged into the applications.

#### What Software Requirements Does Apilytics Have?

Essentially, we work with all types of systems that are using HTTP protocol and our API is
accessible from everywhere. We are constantly adding support for more official client libraries
and tools to use our service.

Environment-wise, there are no restrictions to using Apilytics. We have 100% multi cloud and on
premise support for any backend system out there. You can learn more about our lightweight
