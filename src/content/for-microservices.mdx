### For microservices üê≥

<br />

<p className="text-xl">
  Apilytics is by far the easiest, yet very scalable APM (Application Performance Management)
  solution for your microservice architecture with minimal configuration. The monitoring of your
  applications does not have to be heavily tied to the infrastructure you have. We achieve this by
  gaining all of the important metrics from your application directly from the application.

#### [No host agents](#no-host-agents) {#no-host-agents}

With Apilytics, you can simply embed our open source middleware and there's no need to install any kind of software on the host machines.
You still get all of the information you need, including performance metrics from your server like CPU and memory usage,
in addition to the metrics from your applications API calls.

#### [Set up once](#set-up-once) {#set-up-once}

Unlike with traditional tools, where you would set up the APM software accross all of your servers and clusters,
with Apilyitcs the five-minute setup is the only thing you need to do to get started.

<br />

#### [Works everywhere](#works-everywhere) {#works-everywhere}

Apilytics works everywhere, whether your running your applications in public or private clouds or in on-premise setups.
This way your monitoring infrastructure remains intact even if you make changes to your infrastructure.
