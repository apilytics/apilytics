### For serverless âš¡

<br />

<p className="text-xl">
  Apilytics is the tool you've been waiting for to montor your applications running in serverless
  environments. Our way of logging the application metrics directly from an API middleware makes it
  a perfect solution for any serverless application.

#### [Monitor individual functions](#monitor-individual-functions) {#monitor-individual-functions}

With Apilytics you have the freedom to monitor individual serverless functions or you can set up
a broader middleware that monitors all of your functions.

<br />

#### [Works with every cloud provider](#works-with-every-cloud-provider) {#works-with-every-cloud-provider}

You can be sure that Apilytics works in every serverless environment so you will never face a vendor-lock situation.

<br />

#### [Combine with other APIs](#combine-with-other-apis) {#combine-with-other-apis}

If your application is consisting of multiple APIs, some of which might be running in serverless environments,
you can simply use the same API key to monitor them and you will see metrics from them as separate endpoints in the same dashboard.
