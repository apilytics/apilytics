### Ease of use üëè

<br />

<p className="text-xl">
  API monitoring doesn't have to be hard. Unfortunately with the most tools out there, that is the
  case though. Apilytics is here to fix that. Our 5-minute installation is one of the corner stones
  why you should pick Apilytics.

<br />

Apilytics started from the principle that developers should have their monitoring system up and running in a matter of minutes,
without having to spend time on configuration, deploying new infrastructure or doing maintenance.

<br />

#### [Low code](#low-code) {#low-code}

and you can be sure that Apilytics will work in your environment as long as there is an Internet connection.
