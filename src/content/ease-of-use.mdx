### Ease of Use üëè

<p className="text-xl">
  API monitoring doesn't have to be hard. Unfortunately with the most tools out there, that is the
  case though. Apilytics is here to fix that. Our 5-minute installation is one of the corner stones
  why you should pick Apilytics.

<br />

Apilytics started from the principle that developers should have their monitoring system up and running in a matter of minutes,
without having to spend time on configuration, deploying new infrastructure or doing maintenance.

<br />

#### Low Code

The integration with your backend system requires literally just a few lines of easily understandable code.
Our default configuration supports all of the core metrics you need get started with monitoring your API.
See our [installation docs](/docs/get-started#install-middleware) for more information.

<br />

#### Works Anywhere

Apilytics doesn't require you to install any kind of software on your host machines besides the middlewares that are plugged directly into your applications.

You can rely on us regardless of which cloud provider (or on premise) setup you might use
and you can be sure that Apilytics will work in your environment as long as there is an Internet connection.

<br />

#### Simple Dashboard

Our dashboard is built for everyone, not just for developers or administrators.
Take a look and see for yourself or learn more in our [dashboard docs](/docs/dashboard).

<br />

#### Powerful Metrics

The metrics you get out-of-the-box with Apilytics are essential for every developer.
Things like usage trends and historical data, error rates, response times and endpoint specific data are features that are included from the start with Apilytics.
