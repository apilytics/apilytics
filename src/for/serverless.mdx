#### Monitor individual functions

With Apilytics you have the freedom to monitor individual serverless functions or you can set up a
broader middleware that monitors all of your functions.

<br />

#### Works with every cloud provider

You can be sure that Apilytics works in every serverless environment so you will never face a
vendor-lock situation.

<br />

#### Combine with other APIs

If your application is consisting of multiple APIs, some of which might be running in serverless
environments, you can simply use the same API key to monitor them and you will see metrics from
them as separate endpoints in the same dashboard.
