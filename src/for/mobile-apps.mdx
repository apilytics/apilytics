#### Track mobile app users separately

Using Apilytics, you can track your mobile app users separately from your web application users.
Our dashaboard let's you see which type of clients are consuming your APIs. By using the user
agent filters we provide in our dashaboard, you can easily see stats from your mobile app users.

<br />

#### Combine metrics with other data

By tracking your API instead of embedding various web analytics tools in your client applications
that the majority of your users are blocking, you will have combined data accross all of the
sources. This allows you to easily compare e.g. metrics from your website users with your mobile
app users.
