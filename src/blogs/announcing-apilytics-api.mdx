So far we have been working hard to roll out Apilytics for developers using
the most common programming langauges and frameworks out there, like JavaScript/TypeScript,
Python, Node.js, Next.js, Django, FastAPI etc. We recognize that the amount of tooling
out there is so large that it is going to take us some time build plug & play solutions
for all of them.

Enter Apilytics API. Now you can monitor your APIs using Apilytics,
regardless of what kind of stack you are running. Our API uses <ExternalLink href="https://swagger.io/specification/">OpenAPI specification</ExternalLink>
and our <Link href={routes.apiDocs}>documentation</Link> shows exactly how to use it.

#### [Using the API](#using-the-api) {#using-the-api}

The purpose of the API is to act as an endpoint where you can send your API logs using the specified format.
Our existing client middlewares already do this for you, but now that we have a public API, nothing stops you
from implementing your own API client.

You can choose which metrics and how often you want to log them.
We're constantly adding support for different kinds of API metrics but we already support
crucial stats like response times, request counts, endpoint specific metrics, and much more.
Our <Link href={routes.apiDocs}>documentation</Link> shows you up-to-date information about the metrics you can log and how to use them.

#### [Using Our Open Source Modules](#using-existing-modules) {#using-existing-modules}

We're working towards adding an increasing amount of tools and support for new languages and frameworks,
but you can already use our open source core modules to implement your own API client to interact with our API.

At the moment of writing this we have the core modules available for Node.js and Python environments,
which you can find in our <ExternalLink href={routes.github}>GitHub</ExternalLink>.

Happy hacking! üë®‚Äçüíª

P.S. We're happy to help if there's anything we can do to help with using the API, just drop us a <Link href={routes.contact}>message</Link>.
