It goes without saying CPU and memory monitoring has been around for a long time and most of the monitoring solutions already handle it.
We recognize that these are crucial metrics for all developers, which is why our <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apilytics/core">latest release</ExternalLink>
adds support for easy CPU and memory monitoring, with no additional configuration. We also produce these metrics,
like all of our other metrics, directly from our open source middlewares,
meaning that you don't need to install any additional software on your host machines.

How are these new metrics shown then? We decided to combine them with the other performance metrics that you can already see in our
dashboard, so you can see them in a nice format including the average and percentile values for the CPU utilization, memory usage and total available memory.

<br />

The CPU metrics are shown in their own tab as percentages of the utilization at the time of your API requests.

The memory usage is shown similarly to the CPU metrics, except these have absolute values.

You can also see the total available memory metrics at the time of your API requests.

<br />

In addition to the Node.js support, we are rolling this out also for our <ExternalLink href="https://pypi.org/project/apilytics/">Python packages</ExternalLink>.
Hopefully this adds up some value on top your current monitoring setup.
Also, remember that we're still getting started and our DMs are open!

<br />

Cheers âœŒ
