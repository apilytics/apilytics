Often times developers are proud of their newly created, shiny and _beautiful_ APIs.
But what if they don't have the resources to analyze the real-life usage of their software?
How will they ever be aware of bottlenecks and other problems in their API
if they don's set up proper monitoring?

The issue with monitoring is however, that it is often not trivial to set up,
as it might require you to build completely new infrastructure or modify your existing one or even implement your monitoring from scratch.
The other important aspect is pricing. The big players on the monitoring field are not cheap.
You might be fine starting with some of the most common solutions out there, like <ExternalLink href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">DataDog</ExternalLink>
or <ExternalLink href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</ExternalLink>.

As your API usage grows however, you will notice that your monitoring costs will increase significantly with the traditional solutions.
This is where you might consider either changing your vendor or building your own solution. This blog post
shows you how to add monitoring using [Apilytics](/) to an example application built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

<br />

#### Solution

To demonstrate our API analytics solution we create an example REST API application with Express.

<br />

Let's start off by creating an express application:

```sh
mkdir express-sample-application
cd express-sample-application
npm init -y
npm install express --save
```

<br />

Then define our routes:

```javascript
// index.js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (_req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
  }, [100]);
});

app.get('/foo', (_req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('Foo!');
  }, [200]);
});

app.get('/bar', (_req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('Bar!');
  }, [300]);
});

app.get('/baz', (_req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send('Baz!');
  }, [400]);
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

<br />

As you can see, now we have four different endpoints that each take a different amount of time to respond.
That's all of the code we need for our app. The next step is to set up our analytics.

<br />

#### Adding Analytics in 5 Minutes

Let's start off by creating a free account at <ExternalLink href="/login">https://apilytics.io/login</ExternalLink>.

<br />

![Signup](/mock-ups/signup.png)

<br />

After signup, we will create a new origin to track our API usage.

<br />

![Origins](/mock-ups/origins.png)

<br />

From the menu, we will click on the "New Origin" button to add our API.

<br />

![New origin](/mock-ups/new-origin.png)

<br />

Next, let's copy our API key and finish up the integration in our example application.

<br />

![API key](/mock-ups/api-key.png)

<br />

Let's install our client middleware.

```sh
npm install @apilytics/express
```

<br />

Now let's modify our example application a bit to use the Apilytics middleware:

```javascript
// index.js

const { apilyticsMiddleware } = require("@apilytics/express");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(apilyticsMiddleware("<your-api-key>"));
...
```

<br />

Thats it! Now we have properly set up analytics for our API.
Now we just have to run our application and spam it with some requests to populate our analytics dashboard with some metrics.

<br />

Let's run the app:

```sh
node index.js
```

<br />

The application should now be running on your localhost port 3000.
Let's do a few requests to different endpoints of our API. You can use your browser or another REST API client,
like <ExternalLink href="https://insomnia.rest">Insomnia</ExternalLink> to perform your HTTP requests.

<br />

#### Analyzing Results

After spamming our endpoints with some requests, we can analyze the results in our Apilytics dashboard.

<br />

![Route mtrics](/blog-images/problem-with-api-monitoring/full-dashboard.png)

<br />

We can see history of our request metrics visualized, but for this case it won't do us much since we just got started.
The interesting metrics here are the response times that we can see in the bottom right corner.
We can also see that our API has logged in total of 6 requests that we can see metrics from.

<br />

![Response times](/blog-images/problem-with-api-monitoring/response-times.png)

The color coding shows us the percentage of time that our endpoints took to respond.
As we can see here, the largest red part is on our `/baz` endpoint.
In a real-life scenario of our API running in production, this might be a problem and the dashboard would point that out for us.

Now this is just one example of how you can use Apilytics to monitor your API.
The Apilytics dashboard also allows us to detect anomalies during a longer period of time as well as spot trends in the usage of our API,
get a grasp of the amount of error responses and much more!

There you have it! Now we have a way of analyzing our APIs and we no longer have to be blind about how they perform in production ðŸ’ª
